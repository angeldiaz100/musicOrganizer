Music Organizer aims to be a software for music lovers to organize and play their music. This software can be used in the background while they do other tasks on their computer. 
This program can be seen favorably over other exisitng software because it's local and contains ways for users to organize their music (e.g. play count, alphabetically sort)

Music Organizer is still in it's early stages as of 4/21/2024.
